# Space-invaders
An arcade game called Space Invaders II with Martians appearing randomly on the screen and a ship at the bottom of the screen capable of sending lasers in order to destroy the enemy one by one. The user will have the choice between three levels of difficulty. The higher the level, the faster Martians appear on the screen and are aggressive (they shoot faster).

• When the game starts, if you want to play with an easy level you have to click on F, M for normal, D for difficult or Q to quit.
